The file was by Athoik using some work by Dave Chapman. Does not work on all receivers

Unzip and transfer the attached file to your HDD
ChMod 755 the folder and sub directories

'Telnet' to your receiver and install dvbsnoop with
opkg install dvbsnoop

Change directory to where the dvbstream file is for your receiver

cd /media/hdd/dvbstream/mips
or
cd /media/hdd/dvbstream/arm

On your receiver select the frequency you want to record
For example, Canal Digital on 1 west uses the following home frequency: frequency="12418000" symbol_rate="28000000" Vertical
Ensure no other recordings are taking place or are due to take place

Issue the following command using Putty/Terminal or similar

./dvbstream `dvbsnoop -s pidscan| awk '/PID found/ { print $3 }' | xargs` -o>1w_12418.ts

Stop with Ctrl & C

A recording about 60 seconds long should be enough for inspection purposes using tools such as Transedit
